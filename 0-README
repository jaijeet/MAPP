This is MAPP, the Berkeley Model and Algorithm Prototyping Platform. 

It includes VAPP (the Berkeley Verilog-A Parser and Processor) organized as a
git subtree under the directory VAPP. VAPP has its own README file:
VAPP/00-README. Please read that too if you want to use VAPP.

Quickstart
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This "source release" of MAPP (which you have probably obtained via git
clone) relies on a UNIX/linux toolchain (it needs, eg, autoconf, make,
/bin/bash, a file system that supports soft links, ln -s, etc.).  If you are
on a non-linux system, the build system probably won't work unless you spend
some time tweaking it for your own OS (we cannot do this; please don't ask!).
If you cannot use linux or a compatible UNIX-based OS with all the required
utilities, you should probably download and use the pre-packaged MAPP tarball
available from https://github.com/jaijeet/MAPP/wiki (look near the end of the
page), not this "source release" from git.

0. Your having been provided access to MAPP means that you have agreed to
   abide by the terms of MAPP's license, as laid out in the file 00-LICENSE
   in this directory. In short, MAPP is released under the GPL-v3, while VAPP
   is under the LGPL-v3, unless you have a customized license. The 00-LICENSE
   file contains additional important details; if you have not read it, please
   do so. VAPP has its own 00-LICENSE file VAPP/00-LICENSE.

1. OPTIONAL: the A2oDAEAPI and A3oDAEAPI submodules of MAPP contain additional
   analyses (see Setup/installation for more information). A2oDAEAPI and 
   A3oDAEAPI are git repositories in their own right, separate from MAPP. You
   need to have git to the A2oDAEAPI and A3oDAEAPI repositories. If you do
   have such access, please set them up as submodules of MAPP, as follows:
    # in the top-level MAPP directory, ie, where this 0-README file is located
    git submodule add git@hagrid:A2oDAEAPI.git Analyses2-on-DAEAPI
    git submodule add git@hagrid:A3oDAEAPI.git Analyses3-on-DAEAPI

2. Setup/installation:

    $ autoconf 

    $ ./configure
      # note: the standard arguments --prefix and --exec-prefix
      #       are not used by MAPP at this point.
      #
      # The useful optional arguments to configure are:
      # --with-usercontribs # pull in user contributions to MAPP 
      #                     # (from the contribs/ directory)
      # --with-A2oDAEAPI # enable support for additional algorithms
      #                  # if you have access to the Analyses2-on-DAEAPI
      #                  # submodule (you probably do not, by default).
      #                  # If you do, this option provides access to stationary
      #                  # LTI noise, parameter sensitivity analysis, harmonic
      #                  # balance, shooting, PPV, etc. algorithms.
      # --with-A3oDAEAPI # enable support for additional algorithms
      #                  # if you have access to the Analyses3-on-DAEAPI
      #                  # submodule (you probably do not, by default).
      #                  # If you do, this option provides access to
      #                  # Krylov-subspace based LTI model reduction
      #                  # algorithms.
      # --with-VVimplementation=<vvimpl> # vvimpl = vv1 | vv2
      #                  # VVimplementation selects the implementation of
      #                  # automatic differentiation. Once you start MAPP,
      #                  # help MAPPautodiff for more information about MAPP's
      #                  # automatic differentiation capabilities.
      #                  # The default is vv2. Don't change it unless you 
      #                  # know what you are doing.

    $ make # this will also "install"
    
    The above will create a local installation under ./MAPP-$version/,
    soft linked to ./MAPP-locallinks-installation for convenience. This
    "installation" merely sets up soft links to files in your git working
    copy, so edits to these change the original files. This is convenient for
    code development.
    
    Follow the instructions printed out by make above to ensure that MAPP is
    set up whenever you start MATLAB.

    It is best to make clean before make, since the "installation"
    is non-standard (makes soft links instead of compiling or copying).

    Some useful make targets are:

    $ make releasesnapshot # creates a tarball of your installation
                           # under /var/tmp/, suitable for sending
                           # others as a snapshot of the installation.

    $ make clean           # removes the installation

    $ make autoclean       # removes the Makefile.

3. Testing the installation:

    - Copy or soft link the file start_MAPP.m to ~/Documents/MATLAB/ (or some
      other directory in MATLAB's default path).

    - Start MATLAB. Within MATLAB, give the commands:

        start_MAPP 
        run_BJTdiffpair_DCsweep % a quick test, should produce a tanh() curve
        MAPPtest_quick
        MAPPtest % takes about 10m in MATLAB; longer in Octave
        % MAPPtest('showresults') % to see outputs/plots
        % the following are not maintained regularly, might throw some errors
        run_ALL_A1oDAEAPI_tests % this takes a long time
        run_ALL_A2oDAEAPI_tests % if you have access to the A2oDAEAPI submodule
        run_ALL_A3oDAEAPI_tests % if you have access to the A3oDAEAPI submodule

4. To clean up the installation (eg, prior to commit/push):

    $ make clean
    $ make autoclean

5. Step 3 above does not test A2oDAEAPI or A3oDAEAPI functionalities. Running
   run_ALL_A2oDAEAPI_tests and run_ALL_A3oDAEAPI_tests will illustrate and
   test some of this functionality. Warning: these can take a long time to
   run.
