DAEAPI Wrapper:
	DAEAPI is the structure to present Differential Algebraic Equations for
	systems such as circuits and etc. It contains information such as parameter
	names/values, equations and etc that are necessary to describe the DAE.
	Building DAEAPI manually can be very labour intensive, as DAEAPI contains
	too many fields. For circuits systems, we already have MNA/STA Equation
	Engine so we could implement circuit in cktnetlist format, and equation
	engine will build the DAEAPI by processing the cktnetlist. However for
	systems in other domain, such as RRE, we still need to build DAEAPI
	manually.  
	DAEAPI wrapper is a simplifed format to build DAEAPI. User of DAEAPI wrapper
	fills in only necessary information about the DAEAPI such as functions,
	unknowns and parameters, and wrapper will take care of other information
	automatically. 

How to build DAEAPI with DAEAPI wrapper:
	1. Use 
		DAE = init_DAE();
	   to build the basic skeleton of DAE. 
	2. Then Use
		DAE = add_to_DAE(DAE, 'field_name', field_value);
	   to augment the skeleton structure.
	3. Use
		DAE = end_DAE(DAE);
	   to finish constructing;

Demo: How to use DAEAPI wrapper to build DAEAPI for an simple RC line circuit
	1. circuit: RC line with two segments
	   SPICE-like netlist description
		U in gnd A*sin(2*pi*f*t)
		R1 in 1 R
		C1 1 gnd C
		R2 1 2 R
		C2 2 gnd C

	2. Modified Nodal Analysis Equations:
		KCL_1: C de1/dt + (e1(t) - u(t))/R + (e1(t) - e2(t))/R = 0
		KCL_2: C de2/dt + (e2(t) - e1(t))/R = 0

		input: u(t)
		output: e2(t)
